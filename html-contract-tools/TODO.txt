Things to do here:

- generic validation for form values, bring errors back to each form element

Things that are done:

- have schemas defined in their own files
  - define structure (json-schema?)
- pasted contracts are validated against schema
- have a generic form builder for a given schema
- finish storage of contracts and drafts.
  - Add support for deleting them
  - naming scheme of some sort to identify them easily
